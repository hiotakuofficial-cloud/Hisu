6. Validate quality score per iteration
7. Continue until quality > 85%
8. Final evaluation on test set
9. Production readiness check

QUALITY GATES:
--------------
Gate 1: Hallucination Rate < 10%
  • If above threshold: Continue training
  • Apply hallucination penalty to loss
  • Monitor factual consistency

Gate 2: Quality Score > 85%
  • If below threshold: Continue optimization
  • Track improvement per iteration
  • Early stop if plateaued (3 iterations)

Gate 3: Production Readiness
  • Hallucination rate < 15%
  • Overall reasoning > 80%
  • Quality score > 70%
  • Coherence > 60%

NO RULE-BASED MODELS:
---------------------
✓ All models are neural networks (transformers)

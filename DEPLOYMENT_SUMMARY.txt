RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PRODUCTION USE
================================================================================

1. MODEL SERVING
   - Load model weights from models/production_v2/
   - Use temperature 0.7-0.9 for natural responses
   - Implement top-k (50) and top-p (0.9) sampling
   - Monitor hallucination rates in production

2. INFERENCE CONFIGURATION
   - Batch size: 1-8 for conversational use
   - Max tokens: 100-200 for responses
   - Context window: Up to 2048 tokens
   - Response caching for common queries

3. MONITORING
   - Track response quality metrics
   - Monitor hallucination incidents
   - Log user satisfaction scores
   - A/B test with baseline models

4. FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
   - Scale to 10B parameters if needed
   - Add more anime dataset sources
   - Expand Hindi language coverage
   - Fine-tune for specific anime genres
   - Implement retrieval augmentation for facts
